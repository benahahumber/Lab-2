        <h4>Educational Background</h4>
    </ins>
    <p>I spent most of my high school education
        learning Law, Philosophy and Social Issues courses. After gradudating, I studied Law and Socierty B.A. At York
        U.
        I didn't really enjoy it so I dropped it around the middle of the Covid pandemic. I worked for a little bit
        before
        deciding that I had a intrest and passion for technology, specifically in the new and booming industry of AI.
