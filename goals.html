    <p>
        My goals coming into this program is expanding my knowledge of computer programming and development in as many
        fields as possible. In recent years, I have found the development and advancement of AI technology really
        incredible. I would like to one day work in that field.
        I hope to one day translate my skills into devloping new technologies in AI or cloud computing.
